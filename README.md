Software Description :-
The software components of the patient appointment system include: 
Appointment Scheduling Software: Developed using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript this software module implements advanced scheduling algorithms to manage appointment slots efficiently. 

User Interface: 
Developed using web technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to provide a user-friendly interface for patients to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments. 

Algorithm :-
User Interaction: 
Patients access the appointment system through the user interface via desktop computers, laptops, tablets, or smartphones. 
They navigate the interface to select their preferred appointment date, time, and healthcare 
provider. 

Appointment Booking: 
Upon submission of appointment preferences, the system checks the availability of appointment slots based on the selected criteria. 
If available, the appointment slot is assigned to the patient, and confirmation details are sent via the communication module. 
If no suitable slots are available, the system provides alternative options or prompts the patient to choose a different date/time.
